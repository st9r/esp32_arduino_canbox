Simple example of implementation canbox RISE protocol to communicate with almost any Android Head Unit.
Works on Arduino Uno
You just need to change sketch to suit your needs.

If using Arduino / LGT8F328P (or any with 5V IO) you need logic converter or simple voltage divider for TX (Arduino) -> RX HU line.
RX Arduino < TX HU Not Connected!
